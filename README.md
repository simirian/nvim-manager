## Configuration

### Telescope

This plugin provides an *nvim-telescope* extension.
See the example below for usage

```lua
local telescope = require("telescope")

-- load the extension with telescope
telescope.load_extension("nvim-manager")

-- then access the function with telescope.extensions["nvim-mangager"].projects
-- here we make <leader>fp (find project) open the picker
vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>fp",
    telescope.extensions["nvim-manager"].projects, {})
```
